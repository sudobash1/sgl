Super Grayland will be a great platformer (that is definitely not Mario). Currently, it ain't
done.

Stuff for now: The source for the calculator is in the `src` directory. The old prototype code
for the computer is in the `comp_src` directory. Most code has not been transferred from
the computer code to the calculator and is currently in the process of being done. The computer
code is somewhat old and messy. As of now, the game should just draw the screen in an infinite
loop, so don't put this on an actual calculator. Anyhow, important information on the source is
in `src/readme_source.txt`.

If you find a bug that isn't in a TODO somewhere, please report it by reporting an issue on GitHub,
or, if you can't do that, email me.
